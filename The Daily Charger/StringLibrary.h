#define helpText @"View Schedule displays your schedule. It will default to the current day. Tap on a period to add notes to it. A few things you could put in notes: tests, homework, period swaps, meetings, revised times when there's a snow delay. You can turn notes off in Settings.\n\nEdit Schedule allows you to change your schedule. The first page lets you edit classes by block - you can set the name, room, and color of an entire block. The next pages let you edit each day individually. To add a period, simply shorten the periods that occupy the same time as your new period. A new period is created to fill the gap. To delete a period, resize the surrounding periods to cover up the unwanted period. The final page lets you load a new schedule from a template."
